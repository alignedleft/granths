TODO

x generate table
x color code, label schedules
x ignore saturdays / sundays
x add pure.css
x set up div structure
x check what today is
x render a daily period as SVG
x render daily periods differently per d.schedule





- if schedule type doesn't exist in JSON, show "schedule unknown"

- UI for naming periods apply to you
- display class names inside daily SVGs
- periods that don't apply to you are grayed out (no colors)
- draw "now" marker
- "now" should auto update every so often (say 1x/minute)

- ignore data from the past; take user to today
