- UI for naming periods apply to you
    http://purecss.io/forms/
- display class names inside daily SVGs
- periods that don't apply to you are grayed out (no colors)



- store period and color values in the #
    - make bookmarkable
    - "add to home screen"


- draw "now" marker
- "now" should auto update every so often (say 1x/minute)
